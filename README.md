# esp-iot-quickstart

A starting point for developing IoT projects using the [Espressif Systems ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview). Includes the project boilerplate along with setup code for connecting to a wireless network and MQTT broker. Intended to help avoid repeating myself, a constant work in progress.

# Usage

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/jessebraham/esp-iot-quickstart.git
$ cd esp-iot-quickstart/
$ make menuconfig
$ make flash && make monitor
```
